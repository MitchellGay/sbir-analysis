Rainbow Hospitality LLC dba Curry Fresh,SBIR Phase I: Turmeric Assisted Pressure Sterilization,NSF,2025,302965.0000,"The broader/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would be two-fold: potential reduction of packaged Ready-to-Eat (RTE) food waste, and broader availability of packaged food in its original taste, flavor, and nutrients. The amount of food wasted in the U.S. annually is equivalent to 130 billion meals, with an approximate value of nearly $218 billion. A significant percentage of this food waste happens in the fresh/produce section of the supermarkets due to the shorter shelf-life of various food items from 10 to 30 days. These foods are typically processed via retort cooking at 250-degree F, or freezing, or making food acidic (below Ph 4.6). These technologies are energy consuming, expensive, and lead to loss of most of the nutrients. The proposed Turmeric Assisted Pressure Sterilization (TAPS) is aiming to be the first technology that can extend this shelf-life to over 180 days without compromising on original taste, flavor and nutrient of food items with the goal of bringing RTE food items from the colder sections of the supermarket (below 40-degree F) to the shelf-stable section (about 70-degree F). By doing so, the company aspires to reduce RTE food waste by 20% in the next 10 years. 


This SBIR Phase I project aims to lay the groundwork for establishing TAPS as a breakthrough pressure sterilization technology. Traditional pressure sterilization is carried out at pressures around 6000 bars and 40-degree F.  This project intends to show that in the presence of natural antioxidants such as turmeric, the same level of sterilization can be achieved at pressures close to 3000 bar and 70-degree F. The project, therefore, will focus on preparing and testing a variety of RTE foods under the TAPS conditions and assessing their efficacy by third-party for shelf life, nutrient preservation, and risks to food safety and quality when challenged with common microorganisms. Besides turmeric, the experiments will also involve th"

More than 40 million people in the Western US and over a billion people globally rely on water stored high in the mountains as snowpack that melts in spring and summer. This precious resource is threatened by climate change and associated extreme weather patterns, increased demands and less dependable availability. Drinking water, irrigation and hydropower depend on the decisions by water managers for allocation and release of water when needed. 
Our proposal integrates ground-based weather radar and synthetic aperture radar with advanced machine learning techniques to quantify snow water equivalent accumulation. This approach offers advantages over existing methods by delivering all-weather operations, basin-wide coverage, frequent updates, cost-effectiveness, and reduced need for field collection in harsh environments.  
This proposal leverages NASA's unique observational assets to address critical water resource challenges while enabling commercialization opportunities in climate technology and water management sectors. It builds upon extensive snow remote sensing research and collaboration with stakeholders, incorporating robust data validation, and it aligns with NASA's strategic objectives, supporting the agency's Earth science mission.
Comprehensive validation against airborne lidar, ground measurements, and streamflow data will enable diligent    performance tracking, ensuring measurable achievement of objectives. The project will demonstrate technical feasibility, provide a clear pathway to an operational commercial product, conduct rigorous validation against authoritative data sources, and quantify a multi-million-dollar market opportunity with water agencies. The project goals will be realized through a subscription-based decision support tool for water managers. "
"MOLECULAR INTERFACES, LLC",SBIR Phase I: High Light-Throughput Electrodes for Top-Emitting and Transparent OLED Displays,NSF,2024,274953.0000,"""The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is the generation of more efficient and brighter organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which are the individual lighting emitting elements within the displays of our cell phones, tablets, and smart watches. This project seeks to provide the same quality of OLED display but at 1.5 higher efficiency, thereby allowing a phone, for example, to run at 11% less power, with potential savings as high as 19%. If one considers the power used by the 4.9 billion cell phones worldwide (equivalent to the power generation for the state of Delaware) the cumulative saved power provides a significant effect in aggregate. Beyond large aggregate energy savings, this project provides other benefits to the end consumer. These include better brightness for outdoor usage of phones/watches/tablets, better viewing in augmented reality or virtual reality headsets, and even potential improvements in see-through display applications.

The efficient and brighter OLEDs are enabled by the project’s ultra-thin chemical adlayer which is placed on top of the materials in the OLED stack, resulting in superior transparency of the top-laying metal electrode. This circumvents the problem that has long vexed OLED display manufacturers, specifically, that the thin metal electrode providing electrical current to the materials in the OLED stack needs to be both transparent and conductive. Normally, reducing the thickness of the electrode improves transparency, but severely diminishes conductivity. As such, this thin metal cannot be reduced any further, and still limits the amount of light that can pass from the OLED. The project avoids this issue by making the metal a more uniform (continuous) layer by reducing self-aggregation of the metal, allowing the metal to retain high conductivity at a much lower thickness. This effect is enabled by the project’s technology, which is an unusually effective nucleation inducer. The project validates the effectiveness of the chemical adlayer in OLED pixels and then optimizes chemical structure for increased effectiveness. The resultant chemical treatment is then capable of reaching the targeted metric of 1.5 more efficient/brightness OLED pixel.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.""

"INTERLINK ELECTRONICS, INC",Integrated System and Predictive Model to Assess Air Quality and Rapidly Pinpoint Emerging Sources,NASA,2025,149589.0000,"Natural and anthropogenic sources of pollution, according to several studies, contribute to in excess of 6 million premature deaths per year worldwide, with more than 200,000 in the US alone. The high number of deaths caused by air pollution shows the importance of making people aware of air quality at their location.
Five of the components of greatest concern are listed on the National Ambient Air Quality Standard as part of the Clean Air Act by EPA: CO, NO2, O3, SO2 and PM2.5. In addition to contributing to climate change, these gases and particulate are harmful for humans and attack the respiratory system, penetrating deep into the respiratory system and damages lung tissue and the bronchial system causing pulmonary edema.
Satellites are not able, on their own, to detect how high above the ground air pollution is. These systems provide an integrated measurement through the column of troposphere being measured, not readings at ground level. It is difficult to model the vertical distribution of gases and dust. Satellites are therefore often not very accurate in giving estimations for the concentrations of pollutants in the actual air humans breathe.
AQ models and existing networks lack local resolution since air quality values are highly dependent on local topography and wind direction. The air quality can vary significantly over a few hundred meters in urban areas and around roads and industrial areas. Hyper-local monitoring would improve accuracy of exposure assessments and improve models. Therefore, we offer this proposal for a truly low-cost, reliable air quality system with integrated data from remote monitors and local sensor nodes.

As labor shortages stress supply chains, companies are rapidly adopting robotic solutions to ease the pressure. Manufacturers are recognizing the efficiency benefits of flexible and collaborative robots, moving away from large, application-specific robots that require fixed safety fences. Unlike large industrial robots, collaborative robots can function safely without physical barriers, facilitating easy reconfiguration and adaptation to new tasks. However, the safety limitations of these small co-bots result in systems that are much slower and weaker than industrial robots. The 3D safety sensor system developed in this project will bridge the gap between small, flexible co-bots and powerful industrial robots by eliminating the need for safety fences around large industrial robots and enabling collaborative applications.

"SUMA CONSULTING & INVESTMENTS, INC.",Improve and enhance a device and method to extract ceramic tiles without damaging them.,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"This investigation aims to improve and enhance the Xtractor, a device and method designed to remove installed ceramic tiles without damaging them by applying vibration technology. Property insurance companies can then migrate from full floor replacements to spot repair adjustments. Insurance companies can significantly reduce costs, minimize disruption to homeowners because of no need for relocation and content moving, save time, and eliminate the need and cost to replace other items of the property as kitchens, bathrooms, walls, others because of collateral damage when full floor replacement is required. These benefits prove ideal when seeking a method to adjust a claim that cannot be contested in court because the same flooring is re-used. Other repair methods (Like repairs using matching materials) are highly contested due to the insurance “pre-loss condition contract clause” when there are minor aesthetic differences in the materials. We estimate the United States market potential to be 34,000 homeowner insurance claims per year. At our projected cost of service, the market potential is $156.4 million per year. Because this technology can be commercialized in markets other than insurance, the market potential can more than double. The expected environmental impact includes reducing the embodied carbon in buildings by reusing or salvaging flooring. The estimated embodied carbon reduced with our device is 19.57 kg CO2 per m2 of ceramic tile not re-installed, according to a 2020 life cycle study by the Tile Council of North America (Tile Industry). Considering our estimated market potential and if the average house has 80 m2 of tile, the embodied carbon emissions mitigation is projected to be 53.2 million kg CO2 per year. This emissions mitigation is actually much higher, if including the reduced emissions for less collateral damage (No kitchen or other replacements) when spot repairing vs replacing a floor. The other impact is the reduction of workers’ exposure to contaminants when spot repairing a floor. The Xtractor is a patented technology that was tested in ideal conditions. However, further investigation is needed in Phase I when applied to real on-site conditions to determine if a successful harvest (Debonding target tile without damage) can be achieved in at least 70% of the tested conditions. In Phase II, the objective is to improve the effectiveness of the concept, as well as developing a modular, portable, ease-of-use system that can be operated by one person to launch the commercialization process."
KLAW INDUSTRIES LLC,Low Embodied Carbon Alternative For Stabilization and Full Depth Reclamation Utilizing Waste Glass,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Creating the Foundation for Modern Soil Stabilization. Fly ash from coal power plants is one of the United States' most polluted materials, and today, it is being dumped right in our backyard. Full-depth reclamation and soil stabilization have been a significant advancement in the paving industry in the past 8 years, allowing for in-place material recycling, drastic reductions in the virgin aggregate, and resilient roadways. However, the innovative process relies on mixing industrial waste and high-carbon cement with our roads. This project will develop a market-ready alternative to the legacy fly ash and cement used in the industry today with the waste we send to our landfills. This new material will replace high-embodied carbon materials in stabilization projects and solve contractors' needs by being 10% lower cost, 94% less carbon-intensive, and 14% stronger than fly ash used today. Technical Feasibility & Commercial Applications. KLAW Industries has made a substantial material advancement, allowing the 7.5 million tons of waste glass we landfill every year in the United States to alter the trajectory of the paving industry. The project will deploy prototype material in a pilot project to demonstrate that this technology can build longer-lasting, lower-cost, and stronger roadways for rural communities across the United States. Our target market is stabilization project managers who are forced to use legacy materials of the past with constant cost, quality, and supply problems. Market Size & Performance Benefits & Environmental Benefits. A low-cost alternative to fly ash and cement allows stabilization contractors to provide their customers with an all-around better product while drastically reducing the embodied carbon of the built environment without needing to change their process. The total addressable market for bringing recycled glass to the full-depth reclamation industry is $40 billion in the U.S. As sources of fly ash continue to disappear and cement prices rise, this market will grow at a rate of 6.6% over the next ten years. Utilizing recycled glass in full-depth reclamation projects will leverage one of the country's most persistent and stable waste streams to deploy a sustainable alternative for agencies, municipalities, and private companies completing infrastructure projects. Recycled glass changes the industry by increasing compressive strength by 14%, lowering excess hauling by 62%, and reducing material costs by 10%. Deploying this new material will prevent 7.03 million tons of embodied carbon from entering U.S. infrastructure annually."
Enzymatic Holdings Corporation,Novel enzymatic technologies to reduce embodied carbon across the entire lifecycle of concrete,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Enzymatic is developing revolutionary enzyme-based technologies that leverage Materials Science and Biotechnology to dramatically lower embodied carbon in the built environment. As the demand for construction materials continues to rise, there is an urgent need to develop approaches to sustain this growth while lowering its carbon footprint and other negative environmental impacts. Enzymatic’s technologies will help the US address the need to grow and maintain its built environment sustainably and remain competitive in the growing global market for sustainable construction materials. Current approaches to prevent concrete permeability and corrosion are costly, limited in effectiveness, and negatively affect the plasticity and cure time of concrete. This Phase I SBIR focuses on our flagship innovation, the Enzymatic Corrosion Inhibitor (ECI). This innovation utilizes a patented, engineered Carbonic Anhydrase (CA), an enzyme found in all living organisms. When added into concrete, CA acts as a permeability reducer by combining atmospheric CO2 with calcium to form calcium carbonate, healing the cracks in concrete. Because CA is very small and does not get consumed in the process, ECI can be used in very low doses: only 250 milligrams can treat a cubic yard of concrete. Enzymatic’s goal is to commercialize ECI as an additive to include in concrete mixing to enhance durability and confer self-healing; an on-demand treatment to repair cracks and fractures; and a periodic prevention treatment for continued self-healing of cracks and corrosion, continually preserving the integrity of concrete structures. The self-healing and restorative properties provided by ECI will not only extend the service life of concrete but also reduce concrete repair waste and costs, thereby addressing multiple aspects of embodied carbon in built environment over its lifecycle. In this Phase I project, Enzymatic will establish technical and commercial feasibility by demonstrating that ECI can be produced at the necessary scales at an affordable cost and is efficacious across different types of concrete and in the presence of commonly used additives and corrosion inhibitors. Our objectives are: 1) Scale up production of ECI and produce a batch for testing. We have developed a novel production system to produce the large quantities of enzyme required to scale up our product. We will demonstrate scalability of our enzyme production system. 2) Demonstrate feasibility of ECI on a variety of concrete mixtures commercialized today. Validation will be performed both in-house and by third-party concrete testing experts."
"CIRCLE CONCRETE TECH, INC.",Plient Recycled Steel Fiber Reinforcement to Achieve Ultra-Low Carbon Concrete Buildings,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Substantial R&D is focused on the carbon footprint of concrete but almost exclusively targets reducing or replacing the Portland cement component. Concrete is typically reinforced with steel bars (rebar), wire mesh, or manufactured steel fibers, and the carbon footprint of the reinforcement can approach or even exceed that of the cement. Our innovation is Plient, an engineered recycled steel fiber product that replaces rebar, mesh, or manufactured steel fibers as concrete reinforcement. Plient fibers, which use recycled steel as feedstock, have a carbon footprint from 7x - 19x lower than rebar, mesh, and manufactured steel fibers. Plient was developed through 5+ years of research at Texas A&M University and is being exclusively licensed to Circle Concrete Tech, Inc., founded in part by the research team at Texas A&M. A thorough market analysis indicates that Circle can sell Plient fibers for about ½ the price of rebar and at least 3x lower than manufactured steel fibers. The target market is industrial concrete floors for facilities like datacenters and warehouses, with an annual serviceable obtainable market (SOM) of over $200M in gross sales of Plient fibers that is limited only by the (ever increasing) number of tires recycled each year. Lab tests, customer discovery, and initial pilots indicate Plient is commercially viable with an enthusiastic customer (building construction contractors) base. Tests demonstrate sufficient residual flexural strength – the key design variable for fiber reinforced concrete floors – is obtainable for Plient fibers to achieve equivalent post-crack strength to that provided by rebar, indicating technical viability. However, our prototypes to date have been small, used low fiber content, and were executed without pumping. Potential customers have questioned whether Plient is pumpable and whether standard placement, finishing methods, and equipment may be used at the high fiber doses needed to achieve sufficient strength. This SBIR project will test these questions, with the anticipated outcome that Plient reinforced concrete will prove pumpable and finishable with standard tools, methods, and equipment so that a significant technical roadblock to commercialization is eliminated. Once commercialized, Plient will have a tremendous impact on carbon footprint and reduce landfill waste through higher recycling rates of the feedstock materials driven by the new demand created by Plient. Ultimately, Plient has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of reinforced concrete by more than 2.5M tons annually and save more than $3B in construction costs annually."
BETR-BLOK LLC,"Making Construction Materials from Forest Biomass, Recycled Cellulose and Geopolymers",EPA,2025,100000.0000,"BetR-blok (better block) is a new product with limitless potential as a replacement for wood, concrete and foam building materials to lower embodied carbon in the built environment. The current mix is made from recycled cellulose, and tested with forest biomass. Using forest biomass in quantity will help mitigate methane buildup; ultimately reducing forest fires. BetR-blok requires comparatively little energy to produce and has a small environmental footprint, but uses Portland cement as a binder. Recent anecdotal research suggests that geopolymers may be used as a substitute binder - a positive step toward reducing greenhouse gases. BetR-blok is beyond the concept stage, very near commercialization. Significant research and financial support has come from Arizona State University, the United States Forest Service, the Edson Foundation, local utilities and private donors. A unique BetR-blok prototype manufacturing system that produces blocks made from recycled paper and other cellulose is being used to produce limited test blocks. These blocks have been engineered and approved for local home construction, but require ICC-ES certification, which is scheduled for Phase II, for industry-wide use. An experimental structure has been built and monitored. Planning is underway, which would extend into Phase ll, for making blocks, sheets and dimensional lumber with BetR-blok mix - using geopolymers as a binder - a significant breakthrough. Compared to other concrete building products, BetR-blok is a much better insulator and has many other valuable properties. It is less expensive, easier on the environment and, much more versatile than its competitors. One mix may be used to produce multiple types of building materials. The only barriers to commercialization are establishing production system consistency, finalizing mix research and finishing /stress testing the prototype manufacturing system. Phase ll plans include the transition to geopolymers as a binder and scaling for market launch with the addition of large-scale, automated machinery. We already have the land, experience, expertise, much of the equipment and extensive cooperation research network from earlier grant work, including the resources of Arizona State University, to make this happen. The potential of this project is inestimable-it would result in a new paradigm for manufacturing a wide range of inexpensive, environmentally-friendly building materials.

ACADIAN RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT LLC,Reduction of Embodied Carbon in Concrete via Strength Enhancing Biochar-derived Graphene Products,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"As the most widely used human-made substance on the planet, concrete is a significant producer of CO2. Production of Portland cement, a major component of concrete, produces large amounts of CO2 and is the reason the concrete industry contributes 8% of global CO2 emissions. These emissions result in high embodied carbon for construction projects. A potential route to lowering embodied carbon is to reduce the overall amount of concrete needed for projects by improving its strength. A promising method for increasing concrete strength is the addition of graphene oxide materials, which have been proven as strength enhancers even at concentrations as low as 0.05 wt% of cement. The chemistry of graphene oxide improves cement hydration, and selected morphology can improve structural characteristics within the cement matrix. In the U.S. alone, a 20% reduction in concrete usage would equate to 13.4 million metric tons of CO2 avoided annually, but the barrier against widespread adoption of graphene oxide to achieve this has historically been cost. Graphene oxide is typically a high-cost product, used in specialized applications and in small volumes. It is often produced using graphite, which has no domestic production, and is made using an expensive process and multiple harsh reagents. This project will utilize a patented, low-cost method to produce graphene oxide products from biochar, which is produced from wood waste, a plentiful and renewable resource that is also a carbon sink. The process uses a single reagent to convert chars to graphene oxide products. In addition, the reagent is more environmentally friendly and has high recoverability and recyclability. Previous results showed significant gain in compressive strength of 16.4%, and this project will develop these additives further to improve both compressive and flexural strength. The concrete market is vast with a global value of over $617 billion and it is predicted to surpass $972 billion by 2030 which offers enormous commercial potential. When the aforementioned technologies are assembled in this project, the result will be demonstration of a low-cost concrete additive, derived from renewable resources, which can add strength, reduce overall material requirements, and lower embodied carbon in construction projects."
Symmetry Wood LLC,Upcycling Food Waste into Bacterial nanocellulose to Create High-Performance Dimensional Wood,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Bacterial nanocellulose (BC) can be readily fermented from various forms of organic municipal solid waste (MSW) and used in applications like sustainable paper, leather, and composite reinforcement. This SBIR project focuses on an unprecedented use of BC, solid dimensional wood, which could upcycle a large portion of the estimated 42.84 million tons of food waste in the U.S. still landfilled on an annual basis — including some of the country’s 10 million tons of waste spent beer grain and the 3600 tons of kombucha SCOBY. Specifically, BC will be the primary component of a replacement for endangered tropical hardwoods, entering markets such as musical instruments, flooring, decking, furniture, and paneling. BC resembles the cellulose naturally found in trees and other plants. Symmetry Wood’s technology converts BC into dense Pyrus™ (at least 90 lb/cb-ft) — surpassing the densest tree-derived woods — with the potential for comparable strength and toughness. The primary environmental benefits are two-fold: reduced methane emitted from landfills and less tropical forest destroyed by loggers. Data from Brazil showed that loggers kill an average of 31 trees, eliminating up to 50% of the canopy , to extract just one high-value tree like mahogany or ipê (popular as decking). This wastefulness also pervades in other rainforests. A report by Taylor Guitars showed that 9 out of 10 ebony trees logged in Cameroon, with an average of 4.4 ebony trees per hectare , are left to rot on the ground because buyers (and the market) reject any wood with light-toned streaking . Due to these kinds of practices, replacing even small volumes of tropical hardwood can reap significant environmental benefits. Symmetry’s analysis showed that displacing 10,000 ebony guitar fretboards, for example, would result in sparing the logging of 1,667 ebony trees and the degradation of 379 hectares (936 acres) of tropical forest — or roughly an area of forest the size of New York’s Central Park (U.S. guitar manufacturers use 30 times that number annually — driving the logging of an area twice the size of Manhattan year after year). If the alternative to ebony is made from food waste, it could avoid 514 kg CO2-eq and 1728.5 kg CO2-eq emissions for every ton of upcycled spent beer grain and kombucha SCOBY, respectively, in addition to the emissions avoided from the logging."
"PACIFIC RECLAIMED LUMBER & SUPPLY, SPC",Scaling Reclaimed Lumber Sales & Procurement Through Web and App-Based Technology,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"This project aims to expand the sales and procurement of reclaimed lumber and building materials online, helping to secure the reclaimed lumber industry as a leader in the circular economy. By studying the barriers to listing and purchasing these materials online, we will develop the platform architecture for a new web and app-based platform. The ultimate goal is to create a platform that facilitates the reduction of embodied carbon in buildings through the purchase of reusable materials. The mission of PRLS is to promote and grow the reuse and remanufacturing of reclaimed lumber and materials from the built environment leading to a reduction of solid waste and climate emissions. To accomplish this, PRLS connects deconstruction contractors, reuse retailers, and upcyclers with sustainability-minded architects, contractors, and other industry buyers. The U.S. reclaimed lumber industry is poised to become an $11 billion industry by 2030, but could strive for a more ambitious goal with increased sales efficiency. The construction industry currently disposes of over 27 million tons of wood waste annually, much of which could be salvaged through deconstruction. Reclaimed lumber offers significant environmental benefits, reducing climate emissions by up to double compared to disposal, and sequestering embodied carbon for 50-100 years when reused. However, for the reclaimed lumber industry to meaningfully reduce national waste, it must scale up operations and sales. A key step will be making reclaimed lumber inventories more accessible online, which is currently a challenge. Our goal is to create a simple, trustworthy listing and sales process for sellers and a straightforward, consistent purchasing experience for buyers. Using the existing Pacific Reclaimed Lumber & Supply (PRLS) marketplace as a test case, we will solicit user feedback on the listing process and survey them on their experiences with other subscription platforms. This data will be analyzed and used to model a platform architecture meeting the complex needs of both listers and buyers."
"GREEN OPTIONS, PBC",Enhanced Inventory Management for Scalable Reuse Systems at Bold Reuse,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Bold Reuse will implement an Inventory Management System (IMS), a crucial component of delivering a reliable supply chain necessary to transition from single-use products to reusable packaging at scale. The IMS will reduce labor overhead of monitoring and purchasing, encourage maximum asset utilization and minimize warehouse storage space, prevent rush orders, ensure timely deliveries, and lastly, enable a comprehensive view of our assets to forecast future needs and leverage cost-saving buying practices. The IMS is innovative in terms of architecture mapped to the needs of the reuse industry. Existing IMS do not consider the complexities of reverse logistics. The system is feasible to build. It is a simple deterministic system built upon mature technologies: a relational database and user interface web frameworks. Commercial potential is within Bold Reuse’s own internal operations as it supports major hospitality partners. However, the IMS will be purpose built for reuse logistics and the system may be offered as a software-as-a-service model to other reuse providers and municipalities, lowering the barrier for unlocking reuse at scale. Phase 1 involves utilizing existing operations data to provide internal real-time inventory levels for each product in our warehouses at each stage of the reuse cycle. Phases 2 and 3 involve real-time external inventory for our “venue-based” clients based on sales data. Phase 4 involves a customer-facing reservation system for “event-based” clients which will reduce labor costs around coordinating events. Phase 4 will additionally facilitate increased customer adoption and public exposure and drive full utilization of Bold Reuse’s publicly accessible rental inventory pool. During Phase 5 training and marketing materials will be developed for the reservation system in Phase 4. We will develop materials to promote the system and documentation for users to navigate the system without introducing labor overhead from our team. Phase 6 will build a model to forecast future inventory levels that relies on historical use & loss and predicted use for each client. Bold Reuse has found success introducing reusables to large-scale venues and corporate campuses with a manual team effort. Leveraging our experience thus far, now is the time to build a system that supports our business structure, reduces the effort to on-board new clients, and ensures the reliability needed to bring reusable packaging to scale."

Indoor CO2 levels frequently reach unhealthy levels in occupied spaces like meeting rooms and classrooms, even with existing air quality technologies [3][4]. Elevated CO2 can reduce cognitive performance by 10-15% [6] and exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma [2][7]. The climate crisis worsens these issues as HVAC systems become essential, yet they account for 38% of a building’s energy use and 12% of global energy consumption [8]. VerdeTerra is addressing this challenge by expanding its Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies, focusing on CO2 and VOCs such as CO, NOx, and SOx, particularly in small and medium sources and integration with HVAC systems. The Albero, VerdeTerra’s innovative air purification system, uses cyanobacteria, specifically Spirulina, to absorb CO2, offering a more effective and sustainable solution than traditional air purifiers. Unlike conventional mechanical filtration, the Albero integrates a biologically-mediated process that reduces CO2 and other indoor pollutants more effectively. Controlled experiments with the Albero prototype, which features six micro-tubular photobioreactors, have demonstrated its superior performance in reducing CO2 levels compared to traditional air purifiers and natural air-scrubbing plants [9]. The Albero excels, particularly at higher CO2 concentrations, making it a reliable and viable solution for indoor air quality improvement. When compared to existing technologies, the Albero significantly outperforms HEPA/charcoal filters and natural bioremediators like Spathiphyllum plants by removing up to ten times more CO2 [9]. Its potential integration with HVAC systems could enhance energy efficiency by reducing the need for outside air intake, contributing to lower overall energy consumption in buildings. The Albero’s commercial potential spans a wide range of industries and environments, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings. It is especially suited for tightly sealed buildings where maintaining air quality is crucial for occupant health and productivity. End users, such as facility managers and operators of critical environments like laboratories and classrooms, can benefit from reduced energy use and improved air quality, contributing to efforts to combat climate change while enhancing indoor environments [10]."

"Talon/LPE, Ltd.","Sustainable PFAS Removal from Biosolids: A Multifaceted, Biochar-Based Approach",EPA,2025,100000.0000,"The urgent need for effective PFAS remediation, especially in biosolids, drives this Phase I project. We're proposing an innovative, multi-faceted solution that leverages the remarkable properties of biochar to create a sustainable and scalable process that can be rapidly commercialized in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the U.S. Our research will explore three key strategies: Direct Biochar Application: We'll mix engineered, manure-based biochar directly into biosolids to trap and lock away PFAS, preventing them from escaping into the environment. Leaching and Biochar Filtration: A two-step process where we'll first extract PFAS from biosolids into a liquid, then capture them using a specialized biochar filter. Biosolids Pyrolysis: We'll use high temperatures to break down PFAS in biosolids, while also creating valuable biochar that can be reused. This innovative technology offers several key advantages: Sustainability: It uses renewable resources (manure-based biochar) and turns waste into valuable products, promoting a circular economy. Scalability: It can be adapted to handle different amounts and types of biosolids, making it suitable for both large and small wastewater treatment plants. Cost-Effectiveness: It uses readily available materials and could even generate revenue through biochar reuse, helping to offset treatment costs. Environmental Impact: It significantly reduces PFAS contamination in biosolids, protecting both the environment and public health. If successful, this project could revolutionize how we manage biosolids, giving wastewater treatment plants a practical and sustainable way to deal with PFAS. Plus, creating high-quality biochar for reuse aligns perfectly with the goals of a circular economy, offering additional economic and environmental benefits. Our team's deep expertise in biochar, pyrolysis, and environmental chemistry, combined with encouraging preliminary results, makes us confident in our ability to conduct thorough feasibility studies during Phase I. We'll carefully evaluate each approach, looking at PFAS removal rates, the leftover waste, environmental impact, and how well it can be scaled up.

AXNANO LLC,Reclaiming Beneficial Biosolids : A PFAS Removal and Destruction Approach,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"AxNano proposes a novel, field deployable treatment train for removing PFAS from biosolids, allowing beneficial reuse while destroying concentrated PFAS. The approach integrates two high technology readiness level (TRL) technologies: Sintered Wave Technology (SWT) for nondestructive stripping of PFAS from biosolids and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) for complete destruction of concentrated PFAS wastes. SWT liberates PFAS, capturing it liquid and solid forms, while SCWO breaks carbonfluorine bonds. The ultimate end-products include beneficial Class A biosolids, CO2, water, and salts, that can be reused. In addition, we propose improving sustainability by recycling the heated CO2 and water outputs from SCWO back into SWT. Along with our collaborators at EzraTerra, we have independently demonstrated preliminary technical feasibility of SWT to remove 99.999% PFOS from industrial sludge and SCWO to degrade 99.999% total PFAS. Biosolids produced by wastewater treatment facilities are traditionally managed through land application, landfilling, or incineration. Due to widespread land application and the known presence of PFAS in biosolids, these practices have become a significant source of PFAS release into the environment, posing risk to human health. Current methods for treating and managing biosolids are insufficient for effectively removing PFAS. The collaboration between AxNano and EzraTerra seeks to eliminate PFAS from biosolids and the environment, ensuring safer land application and disposal. This approach will mitigate the risk of PFAS contaminants entering the soil, water and air when land applied, thereby supporting sustainable biosolid management and reducing reliance on landfills and incineration. Our unique value compared to current technologies lies in providing both complete PFAS destruction while preserving beneficial biosolids for reuse. Adopting these advanced technologies could result in a cleaner, safer environment and enhance the long-term sustainability of biosolid management practices. AxNano aims to advance its technology from TRL 6 to 8, by first conducting feasibility testing in Phase 1 followed by in-field pilot testing in Phase 2. The market opportunity for treatment of PFAS-impacted biosolids is significant, especially considering our approach allows for destruction of PFAS and production of beneficial biosolids for reuse compared to complete waste destruction alone. We estimate a total addressable market of $1.9Bn, with a near-term addressable market of $50M. Customers of our system are biosolid generators and/or processors that would purchase or lease our equipment to meet regulations and provide PFAS-free beneficial biosolids to their customers. End users are operators of biosolid/sludge processing plants that would use our equipment to remove PFAS from biosolids."
"PAGE Technologies, Inc","Low-cost, handheld sensors for measuring environmental nitrates",EPA,2025,100000.0000,"The Problem: Increasing pressures on water resources have led to greater water scarcity and a growing demand for sufficient quantities of high-quality water for various potable and non-potable purposes. Water reuse (also known as water recycling or reclamation) reclaims water from various sources such as municipal wastewater, industrial and commercial process water, agricultural runoff, and stormwater. However, the current cost of tools to analyze the water quality is limited, and there is a need for passive, low-cost sensors to characterize the performance of nature-based solutions. The Innovation: PAGE Technologies develops chemical sensors that can be deployed directly into the environment for real-time measurement at a >100x lower cost than competing products. This suite of sensors detects key parameters, including pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, and specific chemical content (e.g., nitrate, potassium). The core breakthroughs of the innovation are twofold: (1) the manufacturing process and (2) device architecture. Scalable printing techniques are utilized to manufacture solid-state sensor arrays at low cost. Competition: The incumbent method for chemical analysis of environmental soil and water is to collect and ship samples to 3rd party laboratories for spectroscopic analysis. This process is labor intensive, expensive, and has a long delay in receiving the data. PAGE’s sensors acquire data in seconds with minimal labor and are more affordable than laboratory tests. Presently, PAGE sensors are less accurate than lab tests (~3% vs. ~15%), but only 15-20% accuracy is required for their intended use case. Commercial Potential: Low-cost chemical sensors that can measure water parameters - including specific ions - have potential in various markets due to their versatility and wide range of applications, including agriculture, conservation, and wastewater treatment. Customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program unveiled controlled environmental agriculture (CEA) as an ideal beachhead market because the proposed sensors would resolve the pressing need for a low-labor method of analyzing their nutrient solution to optimize plant health and reduce dumping frequency. Impact: The affordability of the sensors enables wide distribution, thereby unlocking real-time environmental gradient mapping of key water parameters. This instant data enables immediate actionability to improve water quality, reduce pollutants, and evaluate different intervention strategies. Goal: This EPA SBIR Phase I proposal aims to improve the device-to-device (D2D) variability of PAGE’s chemical sensor technology and develop a handheld nitrate sensor MVP for environmental water monitoring. Furthermore, the MVP will be pilot-tested for environmental water monitoring by various stakeholders, including Bluelab, AquaRealTime, and VyCarb."
"AGTEC INNOVATIONS, INC.",SMARTP Fertilizer - The Environment-Friendly Phosphate Alternative,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"We are developing a non-polluting phosphate fertilizer, SmartP, designed as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional phosphate fertilizers like DAP and MAP. These existing fertilizers are water-soluble, leading to phosphate runoff and leaching into water bodies, which contributes to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms that causes large-scale fish deaths and water toxicity. Phosphate ""fixation"" of water-soluble fertilizers by soil, makes it unavailable to plants. Consequently, crops often utilize only 30% of the added phosphate. Unlike conventional options, SmartP features a root-activated release mechanism, where phosphate is held within a crystal matrix and released only when stimulated by plant root exudates. This ""smart"" on-demand release system will eliminate runoff and leaching losses; reduction in plant available P due to fixation will also be negligible. By eliminating different types of P losses, the efficiency of this fertilizer will be high and it will be effective at significantly reduced application rates compared to the conventional MAP/DAP. SmartP has a 3-dimensional network of polyphosphate and orthophosphate that is bound by calcium ions. Its constituents are phosphate (P), calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N). It will leave no microplastics or any other undesirable residues in soil because all of its constituents are plant food. Preliminary research shows that leaching of P from SmartP is insignificant. A few crop trials have shown that SmartP can achieve higher crop yields even with a 50% reduction in application rates compared to DAP. SmartP is produced from cheap and readily available raw materials available in the country and the production process is clean with no emissions of gas or liquid effluents. It will have a cost per lb that is comparable to DAP; its application rate per acre is much lower than DAP/MAP so cost per acre to the farmer will be much reduced. The yield benefits together with reduced costs will give the farmer a higher ROI. SmartP is suitable for all crops under all agro-climatic conditions. Our beachhead customers will be greenhouse farmers and vegetable growers and subsequent customers will be farmers growing major crops like corn, soybeans etc. This EPA-SBIR project aims to provide proof-of-concept that SmartP can significantly reduce or eliminate phosphate runoff and leaching, while delivering better yields at reduced dosages. In addition to environmental benefits, SmartP will conserve the natural phosphate resources, sourced from limited reserves, by reducing application requirements and eliminating waste."
"Huma, Inc.",UreaHS—A New Humic-Based Enhanced Efficiency Urea Fertilizer,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"This proposal is in response to the need for a more environmentally efficient urea fertilizer in terms of providing optimum nitrogen (N) uptake while minimizing N loss that can occur via volatilization of NH3 and leaching of NO3- and the negative environmental impacts that can result. We propose the development and commercialization of a novel urea/humate fertilizer called UreaHS that is designed to replace pure urea for agricultural use. The name UreaHS is used to indicate that the efficiency of UreaHS is exponentially greater due to the intimate association of urea with a humate biostimulant that possesses beneficial plant effects, particularly on enhanced N uptake, but also reduced N loss. UreaHS has been produced in a process in which the urea are combined in a pastillation process. The result is a hard, dust-free, 6-mm pastille that has 36% N and 15% humic acid. Preliminary work demonstrated that a humate ore concentration of 25% provided the maximum suppression of NH3 volatilization while still maintaining sufficient hardness. Also, corn seedling grow room studies demonstrated that UreaHS with N reduced by 17% could produce plants with similar sizes but with more finally divided root systems and more active urea transporters. The objectives of the Phase I work are to (1) demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of UreaHS pellet production, with low biuret and suitable hardness, using both extrusion and granulation technologies, and (2) compare the field performance, N use efficiencies and ROIs of UreaHS applied at a slightly lower N concentration and UreaHS applied at a 17% less N concentration to urea and urea treated with the urease inhibitor Agrotain. Technical efficiency of UreaHS production will be ass essed via a scaled-up UreaHS production demonstration at a commercial extrusion or granulation facility with selection based on small scale testing. Cost data for materials, labor, and process overhead will be collected to determine production cost. Field performance will be evaluated in a field investigation on corn, conducted at two separate locations with 6 replicates for treatment and 10’ by 40’ plots separated by 2 row buffer strips. If Phase I is successful, a Phase II project will be proposed in which the field performance of UreaHS will be compared to pure urea and other slow-release urea fertilizer in several different geographic regions and different tillage practices."
"PHOSPHOLUTIONS, INC",Phosphorus Control in Soils with Legacy Phosphorus Using RhizoSorb® Technology,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"The persistent issue of legacy phosphorus in agricultural soils presents a dilemma for farmers between increasing crop yields and protecting the environment. This project aims to address the issue through an innovative application of RhizoSorb® technology. It comprises of a mixture of activated metal oxides to manage the adsorption of excess phosphorous and its subsequent slow release based on concentration gradients. This dual-functionality approach not only mitigates the environmental impact of phosphorus runoff into water bodies but also enhances crop productivity, aligning with EPA's goals of reducing nutrient losses while maintaining or increasing crop yields. This technology represents a breakthrough in phosphorus management, offering a novel solution that outperforms existing methods. Unlike traditional approaches, which often focus solely on phosphorus retention, it effectively ""mines down"" legacy phosphorus, making it available for plant while preventing excess leaching. This unique capability to both capture and release phosphorus sets it apart in the market. The technical feasibility of this solution has been demonstrated through extensive laboratory studies, including batch sorption isotherms and column studies, which show its high efficiency in adsorbing and desorbing phosphorus. Additionally, the technology has been tested in pot studies where its slow release of phosphorus for plant uptake and control of phosphorus in leachate have been demonstrated. Adapting this for legacy phosphorous soils would be the focus of this project. This innovative approach surpasses current phosphorus control technologies by offering higher adsorption efficiency, with a potential to reduce phosphorus leaching by more than 50% and providing a sustained release of bio-available phosphorus. These features ensure better environmental outcomes and improved agricultural productivity compared to existing solutions. Consequently, the commercial potential of this technology is strong, particularly in the agricultural sector, where it addresses the growing demand for sustainable nutrient management practices. It is poised to benefit a wide range of end-users, including farmers, agribusinesses, and environmental management agencies. According to The Fertilizer Institute, among the top 20 states for row crops, 33 million acres are deemed to be high in phosphorus, with levels :2:50 ppm. Additionally, its cost-effectiveness and scalability further enhance its appeal, making it a viable option for large-scale adoption. Finally, the implementation of this technology has the potential to significantly reduce phosphorus pollution in waterways, contributing to improved water quality and healthier ecosystems. By enabling the recovery and reuse of legacy phosphorus, this approach supports sustainable agricultural practices that align with environmental conservation goals."
"Prospect Growth, Inc.",Field-Scale Production of Nanoparticle Phosphorus Fertilizers: Advancing to Multi-Acre Trials,EPA,2025,100000.0000,"Overview: We propose the development and kg-scale manufacturing of commercially viable nanoparticle-based phosphorus fertilizers, with subsequent testing of these nanofertilizers on soybean production at the multi-acre scale. Nanofertilizers, composed of nutrient particles <100 nm in diameter, have been shown to possess exceptional nutrient uptake efficiency, surpassing the performance of conventional ionic, chelated, and organic fertilizers, allowing farmers to realize increased yields at drastically reduced dosages. The profit margin of growing soybeans has been close to zero for the past few years, a fact verified in interviews with farmers and checkoff organizations. With this technology, we aim to demonstrate a 50% reduction in P fertilizer input (by mass) while generating statistically significant yield increases of over 5%. This outcome would increase the economic returns for soybean farmers while decreasing overall phosphorus consumption. By demonstrating yield and efficiency, we aim to attract interest from commercial partners in positioning our P nanofertilizer within the agricultural sales network. Innovativeness: We have developed and patented a cost-effective manufacturing platform that leverages bio-derived fatty acids as a key reagent for nanofertilizer synthesis. This platform overcomes critical issues restricting nanofertilizer production, namely high production costs and a reliance on toxic reagents. As others have not been able to carry out cost-effective scaled production, nanofertilizers have not been validated in large-scale field tests, and only one nanoparticle-based adjuvant exists in the US market. Technical Feasibility: We have developed a bench-scale prototype system and validated it to synthesize micronutrient nanofertilizers. Over a decade of peer-reviewed research has established the capabilities and reliability of nanofertilizers, but only on sub-acre scale test plots. Performance vs. Current Technologies: Studies show that nanofertilizers can achieve equivalent or improved (10-30%) yields at a fraction of the dosage of on-market fertilizers. Commercial Potential: Our customer interviews (National NSF I-Corps) and market research data suggest that about half of farmers are interested in nanofertilizers and other agrochemical innovations to boost yields if these increases can be demonstrated reliably and provided cost competitively. Our product is compatible with standard application modes, and industry contacts at large agribusinesses (e.g., Bayer, Mosaic) have shared that these companies are actively monitoring nanotechnological developments. Environmental Impact: Nanoengineered phosphorus fertilizers have been shown to more than double phosphorus use efficiency. Replacing only 40% of conventional fertilizer and accounting for P nanofertilizer manufacturing would equate to an estimated 20% reduction in P-fertilizer use, supply chain-related emissions, and runoff externalities."

Climate change and global trade have led to an increased spread of harmful pests and plant diseases like Citrus Greening. These diseases threaten the world's food supply and cost farmers billions of dollars each year. Farmers are forced to rely heavily on pesticides, harming the environment, human health, and ultimately, their sustainability. Currently, identifying these diseases often involves sending samples to centralized labs, which can be slow, inconvenient, and inefficient. This Phase I project aims to develop a user-friendly, affordable testing device that allows farmers to quickly identify plant diseases right in their fields. This early identification of plant diseases would enable the farmers to practice more sustainable farming methods that would lead to higher crop yields, improved food security, maintain U.S. competitiveness in the global food trade and preserve jobs in the agricultural industry. This on-site testing and data-driven decision making by less-skilled farm workers also leads to increased science education, thus serving NSF’s mission.

On-site testing by farm technicians is a critical need for the early detection of destructive plant diseases like Citrus Greening in the pre-symptomatic phase to reduce the spread of infection and to lessen the prophylactic use of pesticides. This project aims to enable such rapid on-site testing of vector-borne plant diseases through development of a low-cost, battery-operated, accurate, nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostic test kit that can process diverse, hard-to-lyse plant tissue samples and produces easily-readable results in 30 minutes. The main goals of this Phase I project are to develop a simple, field use-friendly hardware kit for sample homogenization, nucleic acid extraction, isothermal amplification and signal readout and to formulate optimal formulations for lysis, extraction and amplification reagents.

While memory-safe languages like Rust can offer greater inherent memory safety, they do not provide absolute protection against exploitable memory issues and cannot replace the extensive body of C/C++ code in the near future. A hardware approach called CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions) has shown promise in effectively addressing multiple memory safety issues using an ARM Morello prototype. However, several hardware enhancements are still needed to fully realize the benefits of the CHERI experimental implementations. To address this need, in this effort, P&J Robinson Corporation (PJR), along with its subcontractors, proposes to design and develop Compact Pluggable Extension Board (CAPER) for selected CHERI hardware prototypes such as ARM Morello. The final output of this proposed effort will be a modular, U.S. -made, and small-footprint extension board that has been integrated and tested with selected CHERI prototype.

The sensors used by the military services can be found on vehicles and systems ranging from simple troop transport systems to drones and seeker systems. As the theater of operation in which these systems have deployed has moved into desert environments and environs with prolonged exposure to salt spray, the degradation of the windows and domes that protect these systems has become a challenge. These caustic operating environments accelerate the degradation of these windows and domes through pitting, gouging, scratching, wide-area abrasion, and surface contamination from operational environments. Although methods have been adopted to repair the coatings often used in these IR applications, there is not currently a satisfactory solution for the repair of the underlying single crystal or poly-crystalline substrate (e.g., sapphire, spinel, Silicon (Si), or Germanium (Ge)). Past attempts at repair of these windows have resulted in degraded optical quality, due to mismatches in the indices of refraction, stress, or thermal expansion.Summit Information Solutions, Inc. proposes the development of a polishing and coating process. This polishing process will use a standard industry practice for ultra-low roughness polishing of dielectric materials. This will first require a rough polish of the sapphire windows to remove non substrate material, such as metal or dielectric coatings, surface abrasion, scratches, and other surface damage. Summit will use an automated polishing stand with controlled polishing head. Summit has previously used this process to prepare X-Ray mirror substrates to an RMS roughness of less than 0.4 angstroms.

In the Phase II option, we will develop and execute a strategy for scale-up and implementation. The outcome of a successful project will be the development of a new bio-derived energy dissipating material with a bio-inspired form factor that can be inexpensively produced at scale.Ā"

"TRITON SYSTEMS, INC.",Atmospheric Water Extraction Plus (AWE+),DOD,2025,249961.6200,"The Department of Defense (DoD) needs to reduce reliance on water resupply to support more mobile, flexible, and self-sufficient military operations. Atmospheric Water Extraction (AWE) technology can generate potable water from air moisture, offering a significant tactical advantage in remote or hostile environments by lessening the logistical burden and risks of water resupply missions. AWE systems work by capturing humidity and condensing it into liquid water through methods like cooling condensation and desiccant-based extraction. These systems have various applications beyond military use, including disaster relief, residential and commercial water supplementation, and agricultural irrigation. Advantages of AWE include independence from traditional water sources, portability, flexibility, and potential use of renewable energy sources. However, challenges such as high energy consumption, initial costs, and variable efficiency depending on environmental conditions need to be addressed. Advances in technology and energy efficiency are essential for broader adoption.ĀTriton Systems, Inc. and its partners propose to develop a novel material to extract water vapor from the atmosphere and produce safe, potable water at a rate of ? 1 L/day using under 100 Wh of electricity. This self-generating water supply will enable warfighters to be self-sufficient, reducing reliance on supply chains, and allowing for more mobile, flexible, and safer operations by minimizing the need for resupply and associated risks and costs. The atmospheric water harvesting technology will capture atmospheric water under conditions ranging from 5 ¢ 50 ░C and down to 20% relative humidity. The material will have large surface areas suitable for both expeditionary and stabilization sizes, providing potable water for 1-150 warfighters. The process uses only electricity, with no heat or thermal energy, operating at under 100 Wh/L of water. This technology promises to be effective across various climates, offering the DoD a versatile solution for military needs."
INTELLISENSE SYSTEMS INC,Broadband Real-Time IP-Based Architecture for Vehicle Electronics,DOD,2025,999995.0000,"The Navy is seeking development of an open-protocol software and hardware solution to support the use of Internet Protocol (IP) devices (e.g., an Ethernet-enabled sensor with an Ethernet-enabled mission computer system) over a STANAG 7221 link without interfering with a MIL STD 1553 connection being used concurrently. To address this Navy need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) demonstrated the feasibility of the new Broadband Real-Time IP-Based Architecture for Vehicle Electronics (BRAVE) plug-and-play module based on the unique adaptation of existing system-on-a-chip commercial physical layer and VITA standards. All BRAVE circuit developments were supported by Systems Modeling Language (SysML) digital modeling. Specifically, the innovative adaptation of existing VITA and Modular Open Systems Approach standards and the use of SysML modeling tools achieves a plug-and-play solution that does not require user configuration once installed. In Phase I, Intellisense developed and demonstrated the feasibility of a real-time broadband data bus capable of supporting a legacy MIL STD 1553 connection and simultaneously supporting a higher bandwidth. Intellisense also demonstrated transmission of data at a higher data rate with higher-bandwidth traffic on a common data bus. Methods for bridging data and providing link status were investigated, and prototype development plans for Phase II were developed. All Phase I Base objectives were met through the completion of all Base tasks. Intellisense also explored the commercialization and technology transition plan and generated a pathway where we envision the BRAVE system can be applied. In Phase II, we will further enhance the design and develop a prototype hardware solution with integrated software. Intellisense will develop a technology readiness level 6/7 prototype and test its data rates; size, weight, and power; cybersecurity; and network management. Intellisense will also demonstrate BRAVEÆs ability to drop in and provide IP connectivity with higher bandwidth over a MIL STD 1553 bus with no manual configuration required."
